# My Résumé

Creating and maintaining one's CV is a task where happiness and satisfaction is
in paucity. This repository is my attempt to imbue some enjoyment into this
lacuna of happiness.

Gone is the squalid era of trying to propitiate one's prospective employer by
gesticulating over a rancid, vesuvian Word Document which purported to contain
your résumé. You may counter with `latex` as a solution to my quandary and...
you'd be wrong. Whilst `latex` is undoubtedly the typesetting champion where
`pdf`s are concerned, the eyes tire at the sight of such a cumbersome language
--- it is trivially easy to get hypnotised by such curvaceous parentheses. Your
great granddad's favourite typesetting language also lack to programmatic
positives promptly require to rapidly iterate on one's CV^[ No doubt rapid
iteration may be required upon receiving rejection after rejection.] Personally,
I'd much rather manage this `gatsby` project which is far more functional and
data driven.

Please have a poke around but don't look at my commits. I will have likely
gotten indignantly slobbish because not matter how easy you make it to update
you CV, you will still detest updating it.
